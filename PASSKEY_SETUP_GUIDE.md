# How to Set Up a Passkey - Complete Guide

## What is a Passkey?
A Passkey is a secure way to sign in using your device's built-in authentication methods like:
- **Fingerprint** - Touch the fingerprint sensor
- **Face Unlock** - Look at the front camera
- **Pattern** - Draw your unlock pattern
- **PIN** - Enter your device PIN

## Prerequisites
Before setting up a Passkey, ensure:
1. **Device has biometric hardware** - Fingerprint sensor or face recognition camera
2. **Biometric is enrolled** - You've set up fingerprint/face unlock in device settings
3. **Device is secure** - Screen lock is enabled (pattern, PIN, or password)

## How to Set Up a Passkey

### Method 1: During Sign-Up (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Fill Out the Registration Form
1. Open the app
2. Tap **"Don't have an account? Sign Up"**
3. Fill in all required fields:
   - **Full Name**: Your display name
   - **Email**: Your email address
   - **Password**: Create a secure password (6+ characters)
   - **Confirm Password**: Re-enter the same password

#### Step 2: Create Passkey
1. Ensure all fields are filled and passwords match
2. Tap **"Sign Up with Passkey"** button (shows fingerprint icon)
3. **Biometric prompt appears** with title "Create Passkey"
4. **Use your biometric** to authenticate:
   - Place finger on sensor, OR
   - Look at camera, OR
   - Enter device PIN/pattern
5. **Success!** Your account is created and Passkey is set up

### Method 2: After Traditional Sign-Up

#### Step 1: Create Account Normally
1. Fill out the sign-up form
2. Tap **"Sign Up"** (regular button)
3. Complete the registration

#### Step 2: Enable Passkey Later
1. Sign out of the app
2. On the sign-in screen, you'll see **"Sign In with Passkey"** button
3. Tap it to set up Passkey for your existing account
4. Follow the biometric authentication process

## What Happens During Setup

### Behind the Scenes:
1. **Account Creation** - Your email/password is securely stored
2. **Biometric Linking** - Your biometric is linked to your account
3. **Security Setup** - Only one account can have Passkey per device
4. **Credential Storage** - Your credentials are encrypted and stored locally

### Security Features:
- **One Passkey Per Device** - Only one account can use biometric authentication
- **Secure Storage** - Credentials are encrypted using Android's security framework
- **Biometric Validation** - Uses device's hardware security module
- **Fallback Support** - You can always use email/password if biometric fails

## Using Your Passkey

### Sign In with Passkey:
1. Open the app
2. Tap **"Sign In with Passkey"** (fingerprint icon)
3. **Biometric prompt appears**
4. **Authenticate** using your enrolled biometric
5. **You're signed in!** - No need to type email/password

### Benefits:
- **Faster Sign-In** - One tap instead of typing
- **More Secure** - Uses your unique biometric
- **Convenient** - Works even if you forget your password
- **Private** - No password stored in plain text

## Troubleshooting

### "No biometric credentials found"
- **Cause**: No account has Passkey enabled
- **Solution**: Set up Passkey first using sign-up process

### "Biometric authentication failed"
- **Cause**: Biometric not recognized or device issue
- **Solution**: 
  - Try again with clean finger/camera
  - Use device PIN/pattern as fallback
  - Check if biometric is enrolled in device settings

### "Passkey button not showing"
- **Cause**: Device doesn't support biometrics or none enrolled
- **Solution**:
  - Check device has fingerprint sensor or face recognition
  - Set up biometric authentication in device settings
  - Restart the app

### "Authentication error"
- **Cause**: Biometric hardware issue or security problem
- **Solution**:
  - Restart the device
  - Re-enroll biometric in device settings
  - Use traditional email/password sign-in

## Security Best Practices

### For Your Device:
1. **Keep biometrics updated** - Re-enroll if you get a new fingerprint
2. **Use strong device PIN** - This is your fallback authentication
3. **Keep device secure** - Don't share your device with others
4. **Update regularly** - Keep Android and app updated

### For Your Account:
1. **Use strong password** - Even though you'll use Passkey, password is backup
2. **Unique email** - Use a secure, unique email address
3. **Regular sign-ins** - Use the app regularly to keep credentials fresh

## Advanced Features

### Switching Passkey Accounts:
- Only one account can have Passkey at a time
- To switch: Sign out, sign in with different account, set up new Passkey
- Previous Passkey is automatically disabled

### Multiple Devices:
- Each device can have its own Passkey
- Passkey is device-specific and not synced
- You can have Passkey on phone, tablet, etc.

### Backup Authentication:
- Always keep your email/password as backup
- If biometric fails, you can still sign in traditionally
- Consider using a password manager for backup credentials

## Need Help?

If you're still having trouble:
1. **Check device compatibility** - Ensure your device supports biometrics
2. **Verify biometric setup** - Make sure fingerprint/face unlock is working
3. **Try traditional sign-in** - Use email/password as fallback
4. **Restart the app** - Close and reopen the application
5. **Check permissions** - Ensure app has biometric permission

The Passkey feature makes signing in faster and more secure than traditional passwords!
